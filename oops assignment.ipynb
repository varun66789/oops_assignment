It restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which helps to protect the integrity of the data and hide complexity.\n","\n","Abstraction: Abstraction focuses on exposing only the essential features of an object while hiding the irrelevant details. This simplifies complex systems by reducing the amount of information that a user must deal with, allowing for easier interaction with the system.\n","\n","Inheritance: This allows one class (the child or subclass) to inherit the properties and methods of another class (the parent or superclass). Inheritance promotes code reusability and establishes a relationship between classes, enabling a hierarchical structure.\n","\n","Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables a single interface to represent different underlying forms (data types), which can be achieved through method overriding and method overloading.\n","\n","Composition: While not always included as one of the core four concepts, composition refers to the practice of building complex types by combining objects (components). This allows for a flexible and modular approach, as objects can be composed to create more complex behaviors."],"metadata":{"id":"tq6zuoxqTdeG"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["class Car:\n","    def __init__(self, make, model, year):\n","        self.make = make\n","        self.model = model\n","        self.year = year\n","\n","    def display_info(self):\n","        print(f\"{self.year} {self.make} {self.model}\")\n","\n","# Example usage:\n","my_car = Car(\"Maruti\", \"Brezza\", 2020)\n","my_car.display_info()  # Output: 2020 Maruti Brezza\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"kGJ_COGQTkUU","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1727588785587,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":1414,"user":{"displayName":"Varun Garg","userId":"11663094782443047067"}},"outputId":"ab577297-97b7-43c6-b532-6fe92e5a2295"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["2020 Maruti Brezza\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Instance methods operate on individual instances of a class and can access instance-specific data.\n","# class methods operate on the class itself and are marked with the @classmethod decorator, allowing them to modify class-level data.\n","\n","\n","# Example of an instance method:\n","\n","class Car:\n","    def __init__(self, name):\n","        self.name = name\n","\n","    def model (self):\n","        return f\"{self.name} Brezza!\"\n","\n","my_car = Car(\"Maruti\")\n","print(my_car.model())  # Output: Maruti Brezza!\n","\n","\n","# Example of a class method:\n","\n","class Car:\n","  brand = \"Maruti\"\n","\n","  @classmethod\n","  def change_brand (cls , new_brand):\n","    cls.brand = new_brand\n","\n","    Car.change_brand(\"Tata\")\n","    print(Car.brand) # Output : Tata\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"ZvU03roLUJH9","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1727589766741,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":481,"user":{"displayName":"Varun Garg","userId":"11663094782443047067"}},"outputId":"6c45639d-717d-4352-d720-9bf4cea46a1e"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Maruti Brezza!\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Python does not support traditional method overloading like some other languages, where multiple methods can have the same name but different parameters.\n","\n","\n","# Example using variable-length arguments:\n","\n","class MathOperations:\n","    def add(self, *args):\n","        return sum(args)\n","\n","math = MathOperations()\n","print(math.add(2, 3))           # Output: 5\n","print(math.add(1, 2, 3, 4, 5))  # Output: 15\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"UiaLdJRkX06Q","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1727589895237,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":509,"user":{"displayName":"Varun Garg","userId":"11663094782443047067"}},"outputId":"6330d35c-feea-40e7-ad44-3721244c1265"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["5\n","15\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["In Python, there are three main types of access modifiers that control the visibility and accessibility of class members.\n","\n","1.
